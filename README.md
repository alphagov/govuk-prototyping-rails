# GOV.UK Rails Prototyping kit

A lightweight rails prototyping kit for pages GOV.UK, not including services.

## Why another prototyping kit?

Most are node, which can't make use of shared templates and GOV.UK components
that require Ruby.

Theres an existing Rails prototyping kit, but tends to use fixed local assets
that have to be manually kept in sync with live GOV.UK. It's also a larger app
and can be difficult to install.

## Aims

* Easy to keep up to date with live GOV.UK styles
* Make use of GOV.UK Components
* Easy to install and run
* Small codebase thats understandable and extendable
