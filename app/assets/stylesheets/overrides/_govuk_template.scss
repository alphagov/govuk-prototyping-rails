// As `#wrapper` uses `%site-width-container` it's bottom border isn't 100%
// width anymore, so doesn't match the GOV.UK design, for now omit it until a
// design decision is made about the border.
// @TODO: Make a decision about whether we keep the bottom blue bar in
// govuk_template + should it match the header? Possibly move into footer
#wrapper {
  border-bottom: none;
